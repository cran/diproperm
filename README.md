This package is available on CRAN (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/diproperm/index.html) and has been tested on Windows, MacOS, and Fedora Linux machines.

Note: Some users have experienced an issue where the R package 'gert' needs to be installed before installing the github version of diproperm.
